# Shift_Calendar
This is a simple, single file, web based, java scripted, bootstrapped -- if that's a word--, shift caledar.  
It is made to run easily on a LAMP server.
I'm pretty sure that this page should run with any PHP web server.  It does not use any database.

Just upload to your web server and voila!
