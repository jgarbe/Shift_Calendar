# Shift_Calendar
This is a simple, single file, web based, java scripted, bootstrapped -- if that's a word--, shift caledar.  
It is made to run easily on a LAMP server.
I'm pretty sure that this page should run with any PHP web server.  It does not use any database.
There are three 24 hour shifts (red,green, and blue) that start at 0800hrs.
There is another two-shift calendar (yellow and purple) that is more like a "swing shift."

Just upload to your web server and voila!
